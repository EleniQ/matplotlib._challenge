# matplotlib._challenge

I found this assignment to be relatively enjoyable.
I didn't use a for loop to determine IQR and outliers, I just calculated them directly and used boolean logic. 
This worked out a lot quicker, and rather than printing out all of the information manually, I just put it into a dataframe. 
Looks a lot nicer. 

## Observations and analysis can be found at the very bottom of my workbook. All additional notation is added into my workbook so you can see the natural progression of the work.
